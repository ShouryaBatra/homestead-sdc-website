          <strong>Accomplishment:</strong> I recently placed 5th in Varsity
          (Open) Congress at the John Lewis SVUDL Invitational, marking the
          first-ever award for Congressional Debate at Homestead High School!
          After three weeks of hard work and practice, I was able to perform
          well despite the tough competition. It was a huge milestone for our
          team and me, and Iâ€™m excited to see more students from Homestead
          competing and representing us at future events. Hopefully, this will
          help grow our Speech and Debate team even more!
